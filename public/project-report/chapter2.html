                    <h2>2.2 Existing System</h2>
                    <p>Popular platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and traditional resume builders dominate the job market but are often generic, ad-driven, and fail to provide deep, personalized guidance for job seekers.</p>
                    <h4>Limitations of Current Platforms:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Generic Templates and Feedback:</strong> Offer basic templates and superficial advice, lacking personalized, AI-driven analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragmented User Experience:</strong> Job seekers must use separate tools for resume building, job searching, and application tracking.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inefficient for Recruiters:</strong> Manual screening of hundreds of resumes is time-consuming and prone to bias.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Actionable Insights:</strong> Fail to provide users with clear, data-driven steps to improve their resume's effectiveness.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                    <h2>2.3 Need for New System</h2>
                    <p>While platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed offer a wide reach, they lack the focused, intelligent tools needed for effective career development and modern recruitment.</p>
                    <h4>Key Limitations of Existing Platforms:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Generic Guidance</strong> - Offer one-size-fits-all advice, not personalized AI analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inefficient for Recruiters</strong> - Manual screening is slow, biased, and resource-intensive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragmented Experience</strong> - Users need separate tools for building, analyzing, and matching.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cluttered and Distracting</strong> - Often filled with ads and irrelevant social features.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Deep Insights</strong> - Fail to provide actionable steps for resume improvement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor Skill-Job Alignment</strong> - Basic keyword matching often misses true candidate potential.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>Why CareerCraft AI?</h4>
                    <p>CareerCraft AI provides a clean, focused, and intelligent alternative—ideal for targeted job seeking, skill enhancement, and efficient, unbiased recruitment.</p>
