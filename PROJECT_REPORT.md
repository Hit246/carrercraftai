## 4. Experimental or Material Method

### 4.1 Design Methodology

The design methodology used in the development of the CareerCraft AI system is primarily based on **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**, which illustrate the logical flow of data through the application. These diagrams help in mapping out how data is processed, transferred, and stored within the system—independent of the physical or technical implementation.

*   **Purpose of Using DFDs**
    *   To identify system inputs, outputs, and processing components.
    *   To visualize user interaction with the system.
    *   To understand how data moves and transforms through different stages.
    *   To separate logical design from the physical architecture, ensuring a clearer view of how features are structured.

*   **DFD Levels Used in CareerCraft AI**
    1.  **Level 0: Context-Level DFD**
        *   Provides a high-level overview of the entire system.
        *   Shows main external entities such as Users, Admins, and Recruiters interacting with the CareerCraft AI system.
        *   Highlights the general input-output relationship of major system functions.
    2.  **Level 1: First-Level DFD**
        *   Breaks down major system functions into sub-processes such as:
            *   User Authentication
            *   Resume Management
            *   AI Feature Usage (e.g., Resume Analyzer, Job Matcher)
            *   Subscription Management
        *   Helps visualize internal data flow and sub-process dependencies.

### 4.2 DFD (Data Flow Diagram)

*   **Process 1: User Registration & Resume Management:** Users sign up/log in via Firebase Auth. User data and resume versions are stored in Firestore. Users interact with the Resume Builder UI, which reads from and writes to the `/users/{userId}/resumeVersions` subcollection.
*   **Process 2: AI Feature Usage:** The user submits a resume and/or job description from the UI. The request is sent to a Next.js Server Action, which calls the relevant Genkit AI flow (e.g., `analyzeResume`, `candidateMatcher`). The AI flow processes the data, returns a result, and the UI displays it.
*   **Process 3: Subscription Upgrade:** A user requests a plan upgrade from the UI. The system updates their status to 'pending' in Firestore. An admin reviews the request in the Admin Panel and approves/rejects it, which updates the user's document in Firestore.

### 4.3 ER (Entity Relationship Diagram)

An Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual representation that outlines how data entities relate to one another within a database system. It helps in understanding the structure of the application's backend and serves as a guide for designing the database schema.

The ER diagram of CareerCraft AI demonstrates how `users` interact with `resumeVersions`, `teams`, and `supportRequests`.

*   **Building Blocks of the E-R Diagram**

    **Entities (Rectangles)**
    Entities are real-world objects that store data.
    *   `users`: Stores individual user profiles and subscription data.
    *   `resumeVersions`: A subcollection storing different versions of a user's resume.
    *   `teams`: For recruiter accounts, containing team data.
    *   `members`: A subcollection storing team member information.
    *   `supportRequests`: Stores user-submitted support tickets.
    *   `history`: A subcollection for the conversation history of a support ticket.

    **Attributes (Ovals)**
    Attributes define the properties of each entity.
    *   `user`: `uid`, `displayName`, `email`, `plan`, `credits`, `teamId`.
    *   `resumeVersion`: `versionName`, `updatedAt`, `resumeData` (a map object).
    *   `team`: `owner`, `createdAt`.
    *   `member`: `uid`, `email`, `role`, `name`.
    *   `supportRequest`: `userId`, `subject`, `status`, `lastMessageAt`.
    *   `history`: `message`, `sender`, `timestamp`.

*   **Relationships (Diamonds)**
    Relationships explain how entities are connected.
    *   A `user` → has → many `resumeVersions`.
    *   A `user` → submits → many `supportRequests`.
    *   A `supportRequest` → has → many `history` entries.
    *   A `user` (recruiter) → owns → a `team`.
    *   A `team` → has → many `members`.

*   **Types of Relationships**

    **One-to-Many**
    *   One `user` can have multiple `resumeVersions`.
    *   One `user` can submit multiple `supportRequests`.
    *   One `team` can have many `members`.

*   **Purpose of the ER Diagram**
    *   **Data Modeling:** Defines how data is structured and related in the application.
    *   **Communication Tool:** Acts as a shared understanding between developers, designers, and stakeholders.
    *   **Database Design:** Lays the foundation for database schema creation and relationships in Firestore.

### 4.4 Data Dictionary (Database Schema)

A **Data Dictionary**, also known as a metadata repository, is a structured collection of definitions and information about the data used in a system or application. It acts as a reference guide for developers, analysts, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands what data exists, how it is structured, and how it should be used.

For CareerCraft AI, the Data Dictionary includes:
*   **Data Object Definitions:** Descriptions of Firestore collections and their fields.
*   **Data Types:** Specifies the format of each field (e.g., `string`, `number`, `Timestamp`).
*   **Relationships:** Describes how collections and subcollections are connected.

The detailed Data Dictionary for this project, outlining every collection, field, and data type, is maintained in the `DB_SCHEMA.md` file.

This document outlines the structure of the Firestore database used in the CareerCraft AI application.

## 7. Testing & Bibliography

### 7.1 Testing

A multi-layered testing strategy was employed to ensure the application's quality, reliability, and performance. This approach combines manual checks with plans for automated testing to cover different aspects of the system.

*   **Unit Testing (Planned):**
    *   **Objective:** To test individual components and functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly. This is crucial for maintaining a stable and predictable codebase.
    *   **Tools:** The plan is to use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Testing a UI component like `<Button>` to verify it renders correctly and that its `onClick` handler fires when clicked.
        *   Testing a utility function, such as one that converts a file to a data URI, to ensure it produces the correct output for a given input.

*   **Integration Testing (Planned):**
    *   **Objective:** To verify that different parts of the application work together as expected. This is especially important for a full-stack application that relies on external services.
    *   **Tools:** This would also leverage **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, but with a focus on component interactions and service mocking.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Testing the login flow to ensure the `LoginForm` component correctly calls the `useAuth` hook, which in turn interacts with Firebase Authentication. This test would verify both successful login and error handling.
        *   Testing the Resume Builder's "Save" functionality to ensure that changes in the UI are correctly written to the user's Firestore document.

*   **Manual Testing (Executed):**
    *   **Objective:** To test the application from an end-user's perspective, covering complete user journeys and identifying any UI/UX issues that automated tests might miss.
    *   **Process:** Manually executed all key user flows across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
    *   **Key Scenarios Tested:**
        *   **User Authentication:** Successfully signing up, logging in, and logging out.
        *   **Resume Builder:** Creating, editing, saving, and exporting a resume.
        *   **AI Features:** Using the Resume Analyzer, Job Matcher, and other AI tools to ensure inputs are processed and results are displayed correctly.
        *   **Subscription Flow:** Simulating a user requesting a plan upgrade and an admin approving it.
        *   **Admin Panel:** Verifying that admins can view users, manage subscriptions, and update settings.
