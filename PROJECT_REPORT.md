2.  **Inefficient for Recruiters** - Manual screening is slow, biased, and resource-intensive.
3.  **Fragmented Experience** - Users need separate tools for building, analyzing, and matching.
4.  **Cluttered and Distracting** - Often filled with ads and irrelevant social features.
5.  **Lack of Deep Insights** - Fail to provide actionable steps for resume improvement.
6.  **Poor Skill-Job Alignment** - Basic keyword matching often misses true candidate potential.

**Why CareerCraft AI?**
CareerCraft AI provides a clean, focused, and intelligent alternative‚Äîideal for targeted job seeking, skill enhancement, and efficient, unbiased recruitment.

### 4.4 Data Dictionary (Database Schema)

A **Data Dictionary**, also known as a metadata repository, is a structured collection of definitions and information about the data used in a system or application. It acts as a reference guide for developers, analysts, and stakeholders, ensuring everyone understands what data exists, how it is structured, and how it should be used.

For CareerCraft AI, the Data Dictionary includes:
*   **Data Object Definitions:** Descriptions of Firestore collections and their fields.
*   **Data Types:** Specifies the format of each field (e.g., `string`, `number`, `Timestamp`).
*   **Relationships:** Describes how collections and subcollections are connected.

The detailed Data Dictionary for this project, outlining every collection, field, and data type, is maintained in the `DB_SCHEMA.md` file.

## 7. Testing & Bibliography

### 7.1 Testing

A multi-layered testing strategy was employed to ensure the application's quality, reliability, and performance. This approach combines manual checks with plans for automated testing to cover different aspects of the system.

*   **Unit Testing (Planned):**
    *   **Objective:** To test individual components and functions in isolation to ensure they work correctly. This is crucial for maintaining a stable and predictable codebase.
    *   **Tools:** The plan is to use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Testing a UI component like `<Button>` to verify it renders correctly and that its `onClick` handler fires when clicked.
        *   Testing a utility function, such as one that converts a file to a data URI, to ensure it produces the correct output for a given input.

*   **Integration Testing (Planned):**
    *   **Objective:** To verify that different parts of the application work together as expected. This is especially important for a full-stack application that relies on external services.
    *   **Tools:** This would also leverage **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, but with a focus on component interactions and service mocking.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Testing the login flow to ensure the `LoginForm` component correctly calls the `useAuth` hook, which in turn interacts with Firebase Authentication. This test would verify both successful login and error handling.
        *   Testing the Resume Builder's "Save" functionality to ensure that changes in the UI are correctly written to the user's Firestore document.

*   **Manual Testing (Executed):**
    *   **Objective:** To test the application from an end-user's perspective, covering complete user journeys and identifying any UI/UX issues that automated tests might miss.
    *   **Process:** Manually executed all key user flows across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
    *   **Key Scenarios Tested:**
        *   **User Authentication:** Successfully signing up, logging in, and logging out.
        *   **Resume Builder:** Creating, editing, saving, and exporting a resume.
        *   **AI Features:** Using the Resume Analyzer, Job Matcher, and other AI tools to ensure inputs are processed and results are displayed correctly.
        *   **Subscription Flow:** Simulating a user requesting a plan upgrade and an admin approving it.
        *   **Admin Panel:** Verifying that admins can view users, manage subscriptions, and update settings.
