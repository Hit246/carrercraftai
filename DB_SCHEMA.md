## Entity Relationships (ER Diagram)

This section describes the relationships between the main collections in a text-based format.

1.  **Users ⟷ Resume Versions (One-to-Many, as a Subcollection)**
    *   A `user` can have multiple `resumeVersions`.
    *   **Relationship:** This is a direct parent-child relationship in Firestore, where `resumeVersions` documents are nested under a specific `user` document.

2.  **Users ⟷ Teams (One-to-Many)**
    *   A `user` with a `recruiter` plan can be the `owner` of one `team`.
    *   A `team` can have multiple `members` (who are also `users`).
    *   **Relationship:**
        *   The `teams` document contains an `owner` field which stores the `user.uid` of the creator.
        *   The `users` document contains a `teamId` field, which links a user to the `team` document they are a member of.

3.  **Teams ⟷ Members (One-to-Many, as a Subcollection)**
    *   A `team` document contains a `members` subcollection.
    *   Each document in the `members` subcollection represents an invited user.
    *   **Relationship:** This is a direct parent-child relationship in Firestore, where `members` documents are nested under a specific `team`.

4.  **Settings (Singleton)**
    *   The `settings` collection is not directly related to any other collection. It contains singleton documents (like `payment`) for storing global application configuration that is managed by an admin.

5.  **Users ⟷ Support Requests (One-to-Many)**
    *   A `user` can have multiple `supportRequests`.
    *   **Relationship:** The `supportRequests` document contains a `userId` field linking it back to the `users` document.

6.  **Support Requests ⟷ History (One-to-Many, as a Subcollection)**
    *   A `supportRequest` can have multiple `history` entries.
    *   **Relationship:** This is a direct parent-child relationship where `history` documents are nested under a specific `supportRequest`.

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Explanation

This section provides a text-based description of the primary data flows within the CareerCraft AI application.

### Process 1: User Registration & Authentication

-   **External Entity:** User, Admin
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **User Signup:** A new user provides `email` and `password`. The system creates an account in **Firebase Auth** and a corresponding document in the `users` collection with `plan: 'free'`, `credits: 5`, and `hasCompletedOnboarding: false`. If the user's email was invited to a team, their plan is set to 'recruiter' and they are linked to the team.
    2.  **User Login:** A user provides `email` and `password`. The system verifies credentials against **Firebase Auth**. Upon success, it fetches user data from the `users` collection to determine their plan and permissions.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`Firebase Auth`**: Stores and manages user credentials.
    -   **`users` Collection**: Stores application-specific user data like plan, credits, etc.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `User Credentials` -> `Login/Signup UI` -> `Firebase Auth`
    -   `User Profile Data` -> `users` Collection -> `Application UI`

### Process 2: Resume Management

-   **External Entity:** User
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Load Resume Versions:** When the user visits the builder, the system fetches all documents from the `users/{userId}/resumeVersions` subcollection.
    2.  **Select & Edit Resume:** The user selects a version to edit from a dropdown. The data is loaded into the **Resume Builder UI**.
    3.  **Save Current Version:** On clicking "Save," the system updates the currently loaded resume version document in the `resumeVersions` subcollection.
    4.  **Save as New Version:** On clicking "Save as New," the system creates a new document in the `resumeVersions` subcollection with the current form data, if the user is within their plan's draft limit.
-   **Data Store:**
    -   **`users/{userId}/resumeVersions` Subcollection**: Stores the structured content of each resume version.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Resume Form Data` -> `Resume Builder UI` -> `resumeVersions` Subcollection
    -   `Resume Version Document` -> `resumeVersions` Subcollection -> `Resume Builder UI` & `Live Preview`

### Process 3: AI Feature Usage (e.g., Resume Analyzer)

-   **External Entity:** User
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Submit for Analysis:** The user uploads a resume file (`.pdf`, `.docx`) via the **Resume Analyzer UI**.
    2.  **Credit Check:** The system checks if the user's `credits` in the `users` document is greater than 0 or if they have an unlimited plan.
    3.  **Call AI Flow:** The system sends the resume file to the `analyzeResume` Genkit flow.
    4.  **Decrement Credit:** If the user is on a credit-limited plan, the system updates the `users` document to decrement the `credits` count.
    5.  **Display Results:** The AI-generated analysis is returned and displayed on the UI.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`users` Collection**: Read for credit check, written to for credit decrement.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Resume File` -> `AI Feature UI` -> `Genkit AI Flow`
    -   `Credits Count` -> `users` Collection -> `System Logic`
    -   `AI Analysis JSON` -> `Genkit AI Flow` -> `AI Feature UI`

### Process 4: Subscription Upgrade (User & Admin Interaction)

-   **External Entities:** User, Admin
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Request Upgrade:** The user selects a plan from the **Pricing Page**. The system shows a **Payment Dialog**.
    2.  **Fetch Payment Details:** The dialog fetches `upiId` and `qrCodeImageUrl` from the `settings` collection.
    3.  **Confirm Payment:** The user uploads a payment proof screenshot and confirms. The system updates the user's document in the `users` collection to `plan: 'pending'`, sets the `requestedPlan`, and stores the `paymentProofURL`.
    4.  **Admin Review:** The **Admin Panel** queries the `users` collection for all users with `plan: 'pending'`. The admin reviews the `paymentProofURL`.
    5.  **Approve/Reject:** The admin approves or rejects the request. The system updates the user's document in the `users` collection to the `requestedPlan` (e.g., 'pro') or back to their previous plan.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`users` Collection**: Manages the user's state through the upgrade process.
    -   **`settings` Collection**: Provides payment details to the user.
    -   **`Firebase Storage`**: Stores the payment proof images.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Payment Details` -> `settings` Collection -> `Payment Dialog`
    -   `Upgrade Request` -> `Pricing Page` -> `users` Collection
    -   `Payment Proof Image` -> `Payment Dialog` -> `Firebase Storage`
    -   `Payment Proof URL` -> `Firebase Storage` -> `users` Collection
    -   `Pending Requests` -> `users` Collection -> `Admin Panel`
    -   `Approval/Rejection` -> `Admin Panel` -> `users` Collection

### Process 5: Candidate Matching (Recruiter)

-   **External Entity:** Recruiter
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Match Candidates:** Recruiter uses the **Candidate Matcher** tool, uploading a job description and multiple resumes.
    2.  **Call AI Flow:** The `candidateMatcher` flow processes the resumes, extracts details, calculates a match score for each one.
    3.  **Display Results:** The results are displayed directly on the **Candidate Matcher** page. The candidate data is not persisted in the database.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   None. This is a transient process.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Resume Files & JD` -> `Candidate Matcher UI` -> `candidateMatcher` Flow
    -   `Candidate Match Results` -> `candidateMatcher` Flow -> `Candidate Matcher UI`

### Process 6: Support Ticket Management

-   **External Entities:** User, Admin
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **User Submits Ticket:** A user fills out the support form. The system creates a new document in the `supportRequests` collection with `status: 'open'` and adds the user's message to a `history` subcollection.
    2.  **Admin Views Tickets:** An admin goes to the **Support Panel**. The system queries all documents from the `supportRequests` collection, sorted by `lastMessageAt`.
    3.  **Admin Responds:** The admin opens a ticket, views the history, and submits a reply. The system adds the admin's message to the `history` subcollection and updates the ticket's `status` to `in-progress` and `lastMessageAt`.
    4.  **User Views History:** The user visits the **Support Page**. The system queries all tickets for that `userId`. The user can view the conversation history, including the admin's reply.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`supportRequests` Collection**: Stores the main ticket metadata.
    -   **`/supportRequests/{requestId}/history` Subcollection**: Stores the conversation messages.
-   **DataFlows:**
    -   `Support Message` -> `Support UI` -> `supportRequests` & `history` Collections
    -   `Support Tickets List` -> `supportRequests` Collection -> `Admin Panel`
    -   `Admin Reply` -> `Admin Panel` -> `history` Collection
    -   `Conversation History` -> `history` Subcollection -> `Support UI` & `Admin Panel`
