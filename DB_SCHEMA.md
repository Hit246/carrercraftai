## Entity Relationships (ER Diagram)

This section describes the relationships between the main collections in a text-based format.

1.  **Users ⟷ Resume Versions (One-to-Many, as a Subcollection)**
    *   A `user` can have multiple `resumeVersions`.
    *   **Relationship:** This is a direct parent-child relationship in Firestore, where `resumeVersions` documents are nested under a specific `user` document.

2.  **Users ⟷ Teams (One-to-Many)**
    *   A `user` with a `recruiter` plan can be the `owner` of one `team`.
    *   A `team` can have multiple `members` (who are also `users`).
    *   **Relationship:**
        *   The `teams` document contains an `owner` field which stores the `user.uid` of the creator.
        *   The `users` document contains a `teamId` field, which links a user to the `team` document they are a member of.

3.  **Teams ⟷ Members (One-to-Many, as a Subcollection)**
    *   A `team` document contains a `members` subcollection.
    *   Each document in the `members` subcollection represents an invited user.
    *   **Relationship:** This is a direct parent-child relationship in Firestore, where `members` documents are nested under a specific `team`.

4.  **Settings (Singleton)**
    *   The `settings` collection is not directly related to any other collection. It contains singleton documents (like `payment`) for storing global application configuration that is managed by an admin.

5.  **Users ⟷ Support Requests (One-to-Many)**
    *   A `user` can have multiple `supportRequests`.
    *   **Relationship:** The `supportRequests` document contains a `userId` field linking it back to the `users` document.

## Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Explanation

This section provides a text-based description of the primary data flows within the CareerCraft AI application.

### Process 1: User Registration & Authentication

-   **External Entity:** User, Admin
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **User Signup:** A new user provides `email` and `password`. The system creates an account in **Firebase Auth** and a corresponding document in the `users` collection with `plan: 'free'` and `credits: 3`.
    2.  **User Login:** A user provides `email` and `password`. The system verifies credentials against **Firebase Auth**. Upon success, it fetches user data from the `users` collection to determine their plan and permissions.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`Firebase Auth`**: Stores and manages user credentials.
    -   **`users` Collection**: Stores application-specific user data like plan, credits, etc.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `User Credentials` -> `Login/Signup UI` -> `Firebase Auth`
    -   `User Profile Data` -> `users` Collection -> `Application UI`

### Process 2: Resume Management

-   **External Entity:** User
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Load Resume Versions:** When the user visits the builder, the system fetches all documents from the `users/{userId}/resumeVersions` subcollection.
    2.  **Select & Edit Resume:** The user selects a version to edit from a dropdown. The data is loaded into the **Resume Builder UI**.
    3.  **Save Current Version:** On clicking "Save," the system updates the currently loaded resume version document in the `resumeVersions` subcollection.
    4.  **Save as New Version:** On clicking "Save as New," the system creates a new document in the `resumeVersions` subcollection with the current form data.
-   **Data Store:**
    -   **`users/{userId}/resumeVersions` Subcollection**: Stores the structured content of each resume version.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Resume Form Data` -> `Resume Builder UI` -> `resumeVersions` Subcollection
    -   `Resume Version Document` -> `resumeVersions` Subcollection -> `Resume Builder UI` & `Live Preview`

### Process 3: AI Feature Usage (e.g., Resume Analyzer)

-   **External Entity:** User
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Submit for Analysis:** The user uploads a resume file (`.pdf`, `.docx`) via the **Resume Analyzer UI**.
    2.  **Credit Check (for 'free' plan):** The system checks if the user's `credits` in the `users` document is greater than 0.
    3.  **Call AI Flow:** The system sends the resume file to the `analyzeResume` Genkit flow.
    4.  **Decrement Credit:** If the user is on the 'free' plan, the system updates the `users` document to decrement the `credits` count.
    5.  **Display Results:** The AI-generated `strengths`, `weaknesses`, and `suggestions` are returned and displayed on the UI.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`users` Collection**: Read for credit check, written to for credit decrement.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Resume File` -> `AI Feature UI` -> `Genkit AI Flow`
    -   `Credits Count` -> `users` Collection -> `System Logic`
    -   `AI Analysis JSON` -> `Genkit AI Flow` -> `AI Feature UI`

### Process 4: Subscription Upgrade (User & Admin Interaction)

-   **External Entities:** User, Admin
-   **Processes:**
    1.  **Request Upgrade:** The user selects a 'Pro' or 'Recruiter' plan from the **Pricing Page**. The system shows a **Payment Dialog**.
    2.  **Fetch Payment Details:** The dialog fetches `upiId` and `qrCodeImageUrl` from the `settings` collection.
    3.  **Confirm Payment:** The user clicks "I have paid." The system updates the user's document in the `users` collection to `plan: 'pending'` and sets the `requestedPlan`.
    4.  **Upload Proof:** The user is redirected to the **Profile Page**, where they upload a payment proof image. This image is saved to **Firebase Storage**, and the URL is stored in the `paymentProofURL` field in their `users` document.
    5.  **Admin Review:** The **Admin Panel** queries the `users` collection for all users with `plan: 'pending'`. The admin reviews the `paymentProofURL`.
    6.  **Approve/Reject:** The admin approves or rejects the request. The system updates the user's document in the `users` collection to the `requestedPlan` (e.g., 'pro') or back to 'free'.
-   **Data Stores:**
    -   **`users` Collection**: Manages the user's state through the upgrade process (`free` -> `pending` -> `pro`).
    -   **`settings` Collection**: Provides payment details to the user.
    -   **`Firebase Storage`**: Stores the payment proof images.
-   **Data Flows:**
    -   `Payment Details` -> `settings` Collection -> `Payment Dialog`
    -   `Upgrade Request` -> `Pricing Page` -> `users` Collection
    -   `Payment Proof Image` -> `Profile Page` -> `Firebase Storage`
    -   `Payment Proof URL` -> `Firebase Storage` -> `users` Collection
    -   `Pending Requests` -> `users` Collection -> `Admin Panel`
    -   `Approval/Rejection` -> `Admin Panel` -> `users` Collection
